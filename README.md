# WordPress Taxonomy Auto-Selection Script  

## ðŸ“Œ What This Does  
- Automatically selects all child terms when a parent is selected.  
- Automatically deselects all child terms when a parent is unchecked.  
- Automatically selects parent and grandparent terms when a child is selected.  
- Works for multiple taxonomies (e.g., "occasions" and "locations").  

## ðŸ”¹ Why This is Useful  
- Saves time when assigning categories or locations.  
- Ensures proper hierarchy without manual selection.  
- Ideal for directory sites, events, or any nested taxonomy system.  

## ðŸ“Œ How to Use  
1. Add the code using the **Code Snippets Plugin** (recommended) or in **functions.php**.  
2. Replace `"occasions"` and `"locations"` with your desired taxonomy names.  
3. Save and activate the snippet.  
4. Test by selecting/deselecting terms in the WordPress admin panel.
